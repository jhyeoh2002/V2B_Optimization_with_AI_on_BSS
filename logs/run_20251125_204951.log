==================================================

	1.1 Preprocessing radiation data...
		[INFO] Radiation data already exists at './data/timeseries/radiation_data.csv'

	1.2 Preprocessing temperature data...
		[INFO] Temperature data already exists at './data/timeseries/temperature_data.csv'

	1.3 Preprocessing building data...
		[INFO] Building data already exists at './data/timeseries/building_data.csv'

	1.4 Preprocessing electricity cost data...
		[INFO] Electricity cost data already exists at './data/timeseries/electricitycostG2B_data.csv' and './data/timeseries/electricitycostG2V_data.csv'

	1.5 Preprocessing battery demand series data...
		[INFO] Found existing battery data at './data/battery_demand_tol26/resample_full.csv' and './data/battery_demand_tol26/resample_train.csv'

		[INFO] Number of series for clean windows = (168, 37)
		[INFO] Number of eligible series for Case 2 = (1378, 37)
		[INFO] Number of seeds ready for Case 3  = (2000, 36)

		[INFO] Case 1 exists — loaded battery demand with shape (168, 37).
		[INFO] Case 2 exists — loaded battery demand with shape (1546, 37).
		[INFO] Building Case 3 (extended random-seed generation)
		[INFO] Case 3 will generate 2000 new series from random seeds
		[INFO] Resuming Case 3 from checkpoint: './data/battery_demand_tol26/case3_extended_generated/battery_demand_ckpt.npz'
		[INFO] Case 3 resume index = 1832, current series shape = (3378, 37)
